/*
How many different ways can you make change for an amount,
given a list of coins? In this problem, your code will need
to efficiently compute the answer.

Task: Write a program that, given
1. The amount N to make change for and the number of types M
of infinitely available coins
A list of M coins - C = {C1, C2, C3,.., CM}
Prints out how many different ways you can make change from the
coins to STDOUT.

The problem can be formally stated:

Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we
have infinite supply of each of C = {C1, C2, C3,.., CM} valued
coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins
doesnâ€™t matter.

Solving the overlapping subproblems using dynamic programming

You can solve this problem recursively, but not all the tests
will pass unless you optimise your solution to eliminate the
overlapping subproblems using a dynamic programming solution

Or more specifically;

If you can think of a way to store the checked solutions, then
this store can be used to avoid checking the same solution again
and again.
